    1. Your immediate supervisor, who has an MBA and must be obeyed, imposes the participation constraint that every new employee participate in orientation. Add a table called newhires, with fields empno, ename, hiredate. Write a trigger so that if you add an employee, he/she will be placed in the newhires table.  Presumably, after attending orientation, the new hire can be deleted from the hewhires table.
	
	code:
	create table newhires (empno varchar2(10),ename varchar2(10),hiredate date);
	
	//create a file after_orientation.sql
	//run: sql>start after_orientation
	SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
	create or replace trigger after_orientation
		after insert on empno on empbb02
		for each row
	begin
		insert into newhires values(:new.empno,:new.ename,:new.hiredate);
	end;
	/
	show errors
	
	output:
	Table created.
	Trigger created.
	No errors.
	
	Test:
	insert into empbb02 values('999','yyyy','zzzz','888','10-dec-9999',9999,30,null);
	select * from newhires;
	delete from empbb02 where empno=999;
	delete from newhires where empno=999;
	
	output:
	1 row created.
	SQL> select * from newhires;

	EMPNO      ENAME      HIREDATE
	---------- ---------- ---------
	999        yyyy       10-DEC-99
	1 row deleted.
	1 row deleted.
     
    2. A 'trace' of rain for a month is define as .04 or fewer inches. Write SQL to determine the number of years since 1850 that August has had more than a trace of rain in San Diego.
	
	code:
	select count(year) as "YEARS in AUG greater than 0.04" from rainfall where (aug>0.04);
	
	
	
	
	output:
	YEARS in AUG greater than 0.04

    3. This one is about user defined types. Make a type named xtrabases which will enable one to fine 3 things: the number of doubles a retired player hit in his career, and the number of triples, and the number of home runs. Also make a variable sized array to hold the teams a player has played for, e.g. St Louis Browns and Washington Senators Create a table called stats with 4 fields: first name, last name, xtrabases, and your array Insert 5 rows, with accurate data for players in the baseball hall of fame.   Choose your players 'at random'.  No two students should come close to having the same set of players. Since home runs are the glamour statistic, write a memberi function called dingers to output the number of career home runs. You should of course 'test' the things you create.
	
	code:
	//create a file xtrabases.sql
	//run: sql>start xtrabases
	create or replace type xtrabases as object (doubles number, triples number, homeruns number,member function dingers return number);
	/
	show errors
	
	output:
	Type created.
	no errors.
	
	code:
	create type my_array is varray(10) of varchar2(30);
	/
	
	output:
	Type created.
	
	code:
	create table stats (first_name varchar2(10), last_name varchar2(20),bases xtrabases, your_array my_array);
	
	output:
	Table created.

	Test:
